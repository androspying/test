### Changed

- CSS styles are no longer loaded from tailwindcss.com in the `/up` view

## [5.4.2] - 2024-11-18

### Changed

- CSP has been turned off (for now) since it breaks the app under Google Chrome. ([#417](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/417))

## [5.4.1] - 2024-11-17

### Security release

- Fix XSS & SSRF vulnerabilities (thx to the XBOW team).
- Content Security Policy is now available and enable by default. CSP helps to prevent or minimize the risk of certain types of security threats.  
  If CSP is already enable on your server, you can set the `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` environment variable to `false` to disable it at 2FAuth level.

## [5.4.0] - 2024-11-08

### Changed

- The links in the footer (Settings, [Admin,] Sign out) have been replaced by the email address of the logged in user. Clicking on this email shows a navigation menu containing the links that were previously visible in the footer. The former display is still available if you don't like the new one, just uncheck the new _Show email in footer_ user option in Settings. ([#404](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/404))

### Added

- Administrators can now configure 2FAuth to register 2FA icons in the database (see the new _Store icons to database_ setting in the admin panel). When enabled, existing icons in the local file system are automatically registered in the database. These files are retained and then used for caching purposes only. 2FAuth will automatically re-create cache files if they are missing, so you only have to consider the database when backing up your instance. When disabled, 2FAuth will check that all registered icons in the database have a corresponding local file before flushing out the db icons table. ([#364](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/364)).
- The ability to export 2FA accounts as a list of otpauth URIs ([#386](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/386)).

### Fixed

- Part of the content of some pages (such as the error page) could be hidden by the footer on small screens.

### API [1.6.0]

- New `otpauth` query parameter for the GET operation of path `/api/v1/twofaccounts/export` to force data export as otpauth URIs instead of the 2FAuth json format.

## [5.3.2] - 2024-10-26

### Fixed

- [issue #402](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/402) Error asking me to log out when using multiple devices, pressing back logs me in anyway

- [issue #397](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/397) Base table or view not found: 1146 Table '2fauth.jobs' doesn't exist
- [issue #399](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/399) Cannot set CACHE_DRIVER and SESSION_DRIVER to database

## [5.3.0] - 2024-09-27

### Added

- The `/up` endpoint for health checks ([#271](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/271)).
- A user preference to close the on-screen OTP after a predefined delay
- A user preference to automatically register a 2FA account immediately after a QR code scan. When enabled, there is no need to click the Save button anymore to save the account to the database.
- An admin setting to make SSO the only authentication method available (does not apply to admins). ([#368](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/368)).
- The ability to assign a 2FA account to a specific group directly from the advanced form ([#372](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/372)).
- A new _Auth_ tab in the admin panel to gather settings related to authentication
- Proxy support for the OpenID connector (using `PROXY_FOR_OUTGOING_REQUESTS`), thanks to [@rstefko](https://github.com/rstefko) ([PR #367](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/pull/367))

- [issue #362](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/362) Cannot use SSO if app runs in subdirectory

### API [1.5.0]

- New `group_id` property for POST and PUT operations of the `/api/v1/twofaccounts` path

## [5.2.0] - 2024-05-29

2FAuth v5.2 offers a new notification feature. Each user can now decide whether they want to receive an email after a successful login from a new device, or after a failed login.

For now, both notifications are __disabled__ by default. Why this choice when this feature increases security? Because if the email configuration of your 2FAuth instance is not set up correctly, such login attempts will take a while (until all email sending attempts have failed).

If you never set up email sending on your instance, do it. It is the only way to recover your account, whether you use a password or a passkey to authenticate. To help you in this task, all required environment variables are described [here](https://docs.2fauth.app/getting-started/configuration/#email-setting). Since v5.1, administrators also have access to a test email button to validate the email configuration from the UI.

Notifications will be enabled by default in a future version.

Last but not least :

⚠️ This version drops PHP 8.1 support ⚠️

### Added

- When [installed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Installing), 2FAuth now offers shortcuts to common actions.
- User authentication logs (See user management pages in the admin area).
- Two user preferences to control the notifications sent when authentication events occur.
- A user preference to set the timezone applied to dates and times displayed in the app.

#### New env vars

- `APP_TIMEZONE`: The timezone applied to dates and times recorded to database ([doc](https://docs.2fauth.app/getting-started/configuration/#app_timezone)).
- `AUTHENTICATION_LOG_RETENTION`: The authentication log retention time, in days ([doc](https://docs.2fauth.app/getting-started/configuration/#authentication_log_retention)).
- `PROXY_HEADER_FOR_IP`: Name of the HTTP header sent by a reverse proxy to pass the original visitor IP address. ([doc](https://docs.2fauth.app/getting-started/configuration/#proxy_header_for_ip)).

### Changed

- `MAIL_DRIVER` env var renamed to `MAIL_MAILER`.  
  This is not a breaking change as the former name is still supported. This is just to stick to Laravel defaults.
- NGINX server now also listens to ipv6 in Docker image ([#336](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/336)).

### Fixed

- [issue #192](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/192) `DB_DATABASE` path not respected by entrypoint script

- [issue #327](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/327) "Keep SSO registration enabled" is not saved

## [5.1.0] - 2024-03-08

Hey Administrators, this release is for you, a brand new Admin Panel has arrived.

With this dedicated space, you will be able to manage admin settings previously located in the User Options view (like encryption, version check, registration). Some new settings are available to better control registration (email restrictions and self-ruling SSO) and two new features are coming: Email Configuration Testing and Cache Clearing.

But the real newness is the user management. All registered accounts are now searchable, the administrator role can be granted to any user, user access (password, personal token, security key/passphrase) can be revoked and you may also delete existing users or even create new ones.

Note that the 2FAuth API has been updated with the new paths related to user management.

### Added

- A user preference to clear search results after copying a code ([#300](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/300)).
- A user preference to return to default group after copying a code ([#300](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/300)).
- The ability to submit a migration text directly in the Import view besides TXT files & QR codes loading ([#288](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/288)).
- An administrator setting to restrict registration to a limited range of email addresses ([#250](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/250)).
- An administrator setting to keep user registration via SSO enabled ([#317](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/317)).
- A test email feature to ensure email sending works as expected ([#307](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/307)).
- A Clear cache feature to... clear the cache, but from the browser ([#316](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/316)).
- Hindi translation, thanks to [@saxenas](https://crowdin.com/profile/saxenas)

### Changed

- User preferences & Environment variables have been moved from the About view to the new Administration panel ([#303](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/303)).
- Spaces are now removed from the Secret when filling out the Advanced form ([#311](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/311)).

### Fixed

- [issue #303](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/303) "Already authenticated" error message

## [5.0.3] - 2024-01-19

## [5.0.0] - 2023-12-15

### 2FAuth v5, the not-so-major release

Why? Because most of the changes are internal and come from the Vue 3 migration. I choose the long way, the one where all components had to be rewritten to adopt the new Vue Composition API and where the whole architecture has been rethought. Thus, despite all that work, almost nothing has changed on the surface.

But it was a necessary step, especially because Vue 2 will reach End Of Life on the end of 2023. Now 2FAuth is also better prepared for futur enhancements.

Ok, so is there anything new?  
Yes, SSO.

Not so bad, right ?

The feature, bootstrapped by [@indyKoning](https://github.com/indykoning) with an OpenID provider, has been completed and now provides a Github provider as well. I plan to add more providers, tell me in the discussion which ones you would like to see. If you need help, the [docs site](https://docs.2fauth.app/security/authentication/sso/) has been updated to guide you through the setup process.

v5 also comes with the following.

### Added

- Single Sign-On (SSO) is now available as an authentication method, with OpenID & Github. Contributed by [@indyKoning](https://github.com/indykoning) ([PR #243](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/pull/243))
- The ability to reveal passwords obscured with dots. See the Options tab in Settings ([#208](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/208)).
- An env var to set a proxy for outgoing requests ([#252](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/252)).

### Changed

- Automatic signed out user now lands on the Login view instead of the Autolock view ([#138](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/138))
- User preferences that depend on another now appear indented
- Letters with diacritic marks are allowed in Group name ([#241](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/241))
- Request body threshold increased to 10Mo in the Docker image to allow importing large file ([#239](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/239))

### Removed

- [PR #247](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/pull/247), [PR #248](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/pull/248), [PR #249](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/pull/249) Useless env var, thanks to [@rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)

### Fixed

- [issue #253](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/253) 2FAs exports cannot be imported

### API [1.2.0]

- `/api/v1/user` GET path added
- `ids` and `withOtp` query parameters added to the `/api/v1/twofaccounts` GET path

__Full Changelog__: [v4.1.0...v4.2.0](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/compare/v4.1.0...v4.2.0)

## [4.1.0] - 2023-07-07

This new version introduces a very common feature in the 2FA app world, the automatic generation and display of passwords.

Since the very beginning, 2FAuth offers an _Open, Click & Get one password_ behavior, this is one of the main reasons why I created it. But this can be very troublesome or frustrating for users migrating from other 2FA apps as almost all of them work with an _Open & Get passwords_ behavior, which is much more straightforward.

So this is now only a user choice as 2FAuth offers both behaviors via a user preference. Obvisouly, the _Open, Click & Get one password_ behavior remains the default one.

### Added

- A user preference to generate and show 2FA passwords on the main view without user interaction ([#153](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/153))
- An administrator setting to disable user registration ([#170](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/170))
- A `2fauth:install` Artisan command to ease both initial and upgrade installation.
- A spinner, during 2FA password loading - By [@josh-gaby](https://github.com/josh-gaby).
- Russian translation, but partial. Want to help complete this translation? ➡️ [2FAuth project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/2fauth).

### Changed

- Aegis migrations with empty `name` properties are no longer rejected. The `issuer` property is then used as a fallback value.
- The Docker image now embed the MySQL/MariaDB PHP extension, so it may be ready to work with.

### Fixed

- [issue #180](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/180) OTP does not rotate while _Close after copy_ and _Copy on display_ is activated - By [@josh-gaby](https://github.com/josh-gaby)

## [4.0.0] - 2023-04-14

Time for multi-user has arrived, here comes v4.0!

This is a first step mainly dedicated to internal changes, so the feature has been integrated gently. For now, almost nothing has changed around user management, except that registrations are opened to new users and some options are only available to the administrator.

This version also comes with nice additions. A light theme, an export feature or the support of custom base url just to name a few.

⚠️ This release drops PHP 8.0 support ⚠️

### Added

- An Export feature (accessible via the _Manage_ view) that lets you download your 2FA data in a JSON migration file
- The Import feature accepts the 2FAuth JSON file generated by the Export feature
- Support of custom base URL. You can now install 2FAuth in a domain sub-directory, e.g `https://mydomain/2fauth/` (see [Docs](https://docs.2fauth.app/getting-started/installation/self-hosted-server//#subdirectory))
- ctrl+F keyboard shortcut to focus on Search on the main view
- A light theme
- IP addresses of failed login attempts are now logged

### Changed

⚠️ 2FAuth uses a new component to operate the WebAuthn authentication that cannot use existing registrations of your security devices. As a consequence, all your security devices will be revoked and the "Use Webauthn only" option will be disabled during the upgrade to avoid any issue and/or lockout. You will have to sign in using your email and password to re-register you security devices.

- The _Manage_ view layout has been rearranged: The search bar remains and the action buttons now stand in the page footer
- Password formatting is now a user option available with 3 formats: Grouping digits by pair, by trio or by half
- Failed login throttling and API calls throttling can be configured in the .env file
- Logs give more information
- Upgrade to Laravel 9.0

### Removed

- The ability to set a Secret in a plain text format (in the advanced form). This was confusing and without any benefit.

### Fixed

## [3.4.2] - 2023-01-25

- [issue #141](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/141) Digits field is missing in advanced form

## [3.4.0] - 2022-10-20

This release is a big step towards more accessibility. Keyboard navigation is now fully supported, with clean and consistent focus, and several UI components have received relevant ARIA properties to support assistive technologies.

It also provides a rewritten Import feature that supports new export formats (Aegis and 2FAS Authenticators) and more to come.

⚠️ This release should be the last that supports PHP 8.0

### Added

- An option to check for new release on Github ([#127](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/127))
- An option to automatically copy One-Time Passwords when they are displayed ([#125](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/125))
- [Aegis](https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis) and [2FAS](https://2fas.com/) export formats are now supported by the Import feature ([#128](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/128))
- (Partial) Spanish and Chinese (simplified) localizations

### Changed

- Password fields can reveal the password and inform about the password strength ([#124](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/124))

### Fixed

- [issue #126](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/126) HOTP counters are not updated after OTP generation

## [3.3.1-3.3.2] - 2022-08-02
